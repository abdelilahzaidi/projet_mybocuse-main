## Project details
The MyBocus site is a platform for Bocus Academy apprentices and chefs. It allows apprentices to notify that they are present. They can also enter recipes to be presented during their course.
They also have a private member area with their personal information.
Of course, the chef of the academy have a different interface (they are chef ðŸ˜‰ )

## Context

 This group project is a consolidation project, meant to make us work both our frontend skills & what we learned so far about backend (PHP) and databases (mySQL).
We divided the work into two groups. A front team, a backend team. We used the  [Github project](https://github.com/NalessoAxel/projet_mybocuse/projects/1)to keep each other informed of each other's progress. Also before coding we've done a excalidraw to see what's we have to do.
